## üìù Mandatory Assignment Chapters

### [üîó Assignment 1 Summary - OMNET++](https://github.com/589664/ADA512/tree/main/OMNET%2B%2B)

#### Assignment 1 Summary - OMNET++ (Part 1)

In this assignment, a simulation for the Sogn og Fjordane ferry system was created. The simulation included 60 cars arriving at the ferry terminal with an exponential distribution of one car every 60 seconds, along with one bus arriving with an exponential distribution of one bus every 3600 seconds. The ferry operated on a regular schedule, departing every 60 minutes, with a capacity for 65 vehicles. Buses were given priority for boarding, and both buses and cars occupied the same amount of space on the ferry.

The primary objectives for this assignment were as follows:

1. Development of a simulation model for the ferry system.
2. Creation of charts to illustrate the queue sizes for both buses and cars waiting at the waterfront.
3. Generation of a chart depicting the available empty spots on the ferry.

#### Assignment Summary 1 - OMNET++ (Part 2)

The second part of this assignment focused on Aloha simulation, particularly in an overloaded scenario. The tasks included the addition of histograms and charts to record the number of collisions and transmitted packages. Two specific situations were tested:

1. Changing the number of hosts (numHosts) from 20 to 10.
2. Doubling the transmission speed.

A comparative analysis was conducted between the outcomes of scenario 1 and scenario 2 to identify potential differences in the simulation results.

### [üîó Assignment 2 - C#](https://github.com/589664/ADA512/tree/main/c%23)

This assignment explored the influence of communication delays on the quality of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control. It involved the following components:

1. Setting up a test environment on a personal computer (PC) with PID simulation.
2. Creating charts to visualize PID control performance.
3. Establishing communication between two processes.
4. Enabling communication between two separate PCs using both UDP and TCP protocols as optional variations.

Key experimentations included:

1. Investigating the impact of the distance (time) between two PCs on PID control. This experiment involved two PCs situated in the same room or different locations.
2. Assessing how environmental factors, particularly communication traffic, affected PID control performance by comparing scenarios with no network traffic to scenarios with high network traffic.
